<strong>Please note</strong> Please bear with us. This site is currently under construction.

Trash Panda is a project, founded by activists, that has one goal: To bring anti-racist and anti-fascist punk rock to the Reno area.

We bring punk rock bands to various venues around, and strive to make most shows all-ages.
